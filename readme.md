Welcome to the repository for the 2DMatGMM website. The project provides a comprehensive platform to analyze, filter, and find suitable flakes for stacking. Our backend is powered by Flask-Python while the frontend utilizes React-Javascript for an optimized user interface.

## Features

- **Filtering:** Filter the flakes based on their properties such as size, shape, and quality.
- **Analysis:** Analyze the flakes in detail by viewing them in multiple different magnifications.
- **Download:** Download the raw flake images from the microscope as well as their metadata for further analysis.

## Repository Structure

The paper comprises three repositories each containing a part of the project:

- [2DMatGMM](https://github.com/Jaluus/2DMatGMM): The code for the machine learning model and the detection algorithm.
- [2DMatGMM-System](https://github.com/Jaluus/2DMatGMM-System): The full detection system used in the laboratory.
- [**2DMatGMM-Website**](https://github.com/Jaluus/2DMatGMM-Website): The code for the website to analyse, filter and download the flakes.
